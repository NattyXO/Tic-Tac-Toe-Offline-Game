# Tic Tac Toe Offline Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that can be played offline between two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking a cell with their respective symbol (either 'X' or 'O'). The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.
